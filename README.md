# DeskClaw

DeskClaw is a local-first conversational commerce agent prototype for small direct-to-consumer brands. The project is intended to demonstrate automated support, basic product assistance, and safe human handoff using local business documents, local product data, OpenClaw, and a local Ollama model.

This repository is currently the planning and bootstrap workspace for the prototype. The main project direction is described in:

- [`PROPOSAL.md`](PROPOSAL.md)
- [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
- [`LEARNING.md`](LEARNING.md)

## Current Status

The repo is documentation-first right now. It has the project proposal, architecture notes, contributor guidance, OpenClaw setup notes, and a devcontainer configuration.

The actual DeskClaw prototype workspace, skills, knowledge files, catalog fixtures, and scripted chat scenarios are planned but not fully implemented yet.

## Development Setup

The recommended development workflow is to use the included VS Code devcontainer. This keeps the project Node.js, npm, OpenClaw, Codex, and Gemini CLI setup inside a Linux container, so Windows and macOS teammates do not need matching host Node/npm installations.

### Host Prerequisites

Install these on your own machine before opening the project:

- Docker Desktop or another compatible Docker runtime
- VS Code
- VS Code Dev Containers extension
- Ollama, installed natively on the host machine

On macOS, it is fine if you normally use Homebrew for your personal tools. The project Node/npm tools are installed inside the devcontainer, not through `brew`.

### First-Time Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
3. Keep `.env` local and do not commit real credentials.
4. Open the repository in VS Code.
5. Choose **Reopen in Container** when prompted.
6. Make sure Ollama is running on the host machine.

The default `.env.example` assumes Ollama is reachable from the container at:

```text
http://host.docker.internal:11434
```

This is the expected Docker Desktop address on Windows and macOS.

### Devcontainer Notes

The devcontainer:

- Uses the Microsoft Node.js and TypeScript devcontainer image
- Loads local environment variables from `.env`
- Forwards port `18789` for the OpenClaw gateway
- Mounts persistent Docker volumes for Codex, Gemini, and OpenClaw state
- Installs `bubblewrap`, `@google/gemini-cli`, `@openai/codex`, and `openclaw@latest`

OpenClaw is intentionally installed globally inside the container instead of inside the shared repository folder. This avoids slow or fragile file operations across Windows/macOS host mounts.

## Useful OpenClaw Commands

Inside the devcontainer:

```bash
openclaw onboard
openclaw gateway
openclaw tui
openclaw sessions list
openclaw reset
```

When onboarding inside Docker, skip daemon/service installation.

## Planned Prototype Layout

The first implementation pass is expected to create a small OpenClaw workspace similar to:

```text
deskclaw-workspace/
  openclaw.config.json
  SOUL.md
  AGENTS.md
  knowledge/
    shipping.md
    returns.md
    faq.md
  catalog/
    products.json
  scenarios/
    support-chat.md
    sales-chat.md
    frustration-chat.md
  skills/
    sentiment_router.js
    policy_oracle.js
    search_products.js
```

## Scope

The current MVP focuses on:

- Simulated chat workflows
- Local policy and FAQ answers
- Basic local product recommendations
- Sentiment-based escalation to a human
- Local-first orchestration with OpenClaw and Ollama

Real messaging integrations, appointment booking, Gmail integration, dashboards, QR setup flows, and promo-code negotiation are future extensions, not part of the first prototype scope.
